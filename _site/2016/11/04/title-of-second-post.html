<p>J: This is a Ruby Post.</p>

<p>The main place where libraries are hosted is RubyGems.org, a public repository of gems that can be searched and installed onto your machine. You may browse and search for gems using the RubyGems website, or use the gem command.</p>

<p>Using gem search -r, you can search RubyGems’ repository. For instance, gem search -r rails will return a list of Rails-related gems. With the –local (-l) option, you would perform a local search through your installed gems. To install a gem, use gem install [gem]. Browsing installed gems is done with gem list. For more information about the gem command, see below or head to RubyGems’ docs.</p>

<p>There are other sources of libraries though. GitHub is the main Ruby-related content repository. Most often a gem source code will be hosted on GitHub while being published as a fully-fledged gem to RubyGems.org.</p>

<p>The Ruby Toolbox is a project that makes it easy to explore open source Ruby projects. It has categories for various common development tasks, collects a lot of information about the projects like release and commit activity or dependencies and rates projects based on their popularity on RubyGems.org and GitHub. This makes it easy to find a gem which solves a particular problem such as web frameworks, documentation tools and code quality libraries.</p>
